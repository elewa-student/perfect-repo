This is a demo of a finished project repo.
Finshed projects aren't just working code. 
  
A finished repo will have: 
  * a descriptive readme  
  * a gh-pages demo or landing page
  * tags for important steps
  * branches when necessecary
  * helpful commit messages
  * a todo list: no project is every truely finished
